  <p>The OpenFaces <cite>LoadBundle</cite> component is used for loading a resource bundle localized for the Locale of the current view, and expose it (as a Map) in the request attributes of the current request. The <span class="tag">&lt;q:loadBundle&gt;</span> component is similar to the <span class="tag">&lt;f:loadBundle&gt;</span> from the Reference or MyFaces JSF implementation but can be used in the components with Ajax enabled.</p>
