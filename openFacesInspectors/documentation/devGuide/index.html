	<p>OpenFaces Inspectors is a package of so called inspectors created specially to make it easier and faster to test OpenFaces JSF components with Selenium.</p>
    <p>OpenFaces Inspectors uses Selenium Inspector open-source library and extends it's functionality to better meet the requirements for testing of OpenFaces JSF components. Selenium Inspector library itself is an add-on on top of Selenium for simplifying automated testing of Web components, pages and applications, especially those written using JSF.   
	Selenium Inspector provides an API similar to that of Selenium in many respects, but is simpler to use in many cases and provides a bit higher level of abstraction. <br/>You can find more details about Selenium Inspector library by visiting <a href="http://www.seleniuminspector.org">http://www.seleniuminspector.org</a>.</p>
